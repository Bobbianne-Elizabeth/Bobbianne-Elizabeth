- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bobbianne-Elizabeth
- 👀 I’m interested in creating a new VR/EMDR app
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code (already know CCS, HTML, and some JS but pushing myself to develop my VR/EMDR app) and data engineering 
- 💞️ I’m looking to hire someone to help me with building my app as I have a pending SBIR grant.
